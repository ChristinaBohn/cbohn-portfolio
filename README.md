# christina bohn | web developer

Welcome to my Portfolio Page! It is under construction.

## Description

This is my personal web page, built using React and MUI Components. It is showcasing the projects I am most proud of and gives a little information on my backgroud, along with a space to get in touch.

## Technologies Used

    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Javascript
    * React.js
    * Material UI

## What I Learned

My biggest takeaway on this project is that good and deployed is better than attempting perfection and never deploying. There may be bugs left to work out or styling to hone, but a finished functional project is the goal of starting - keeping that in sight helps with pushing out the last 10% of work!
